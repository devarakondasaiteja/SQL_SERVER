/*Binomial Distribution

    Fixed no. of Trials (n) [10 pie throws].
    Although, only 2 possible outcomes are possible.
    Basically, a probability of Success is constant(p).
    Moreover, each Trial is independent.
    Also, it predicts no.s of successes within a set no. of trials.
    Generally, we use it to test for Independence.

Poisson Distribution

    Infinite no. of Trials.
    Also, it has unlimited no. of outcomes possible.
    Basically, mean of the distribution is the same for all intervals.
    Generally, no. of occurrence in any given interval independent of others.
    Also, it Predicts no. of occurrences per unit, Time, Space.
    Moreover, we use it to test for independence.*/
 -- OLS IN STATISTICS
 /*Basically, it is a type of statistical technique. That is being used for modeling. Also, 
 used for analysis of linear relationships between a response variable. Further, if there is a relationship between two variables appears to be linear.
 Then a straight line can be fit to the data to model the relationship.
The linear equation for a bivariate regression takes the following form:
y=mx+c
Where y = response(dependent) variable
m = gradient(slope)
x = predictor(independent) variable
C = is the intercept*/

-- chi squre test
--Basically, it is a statistical method which is being used to determine if two categorical variables have a significant correlation between them.
--Also, we have to choose both variables from the same population And they should be categorized as − Male/Female, Red/Green Yes/No, etc.

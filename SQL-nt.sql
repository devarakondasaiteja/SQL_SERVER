--SQL
/*Data Science is the study and analysis of data. In order to analyze the data, we need to extract it from the database. 
This is where SQL comes. Relational Database Management is an important part of Data Science*/

/*Many database platforms are modelled after SQL. This is because it has become a standard for many database systems.
modern big data systems like Hadoop, Spark make use of SQL for maintaining relational database systems and processing structured data. */

/*  Data Science needs SQL in order to handle structured data. This structured data is stored in relational databases. 
Therefore, in order to query these databases, must have a knowledge of SQL.
Big Data Platforms like Hadoop provides an extension for querying SQL commands for manipulating data through HiveQL.*/
